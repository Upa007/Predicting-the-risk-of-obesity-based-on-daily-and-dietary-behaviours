# Predicting-the-risk-of-obesity-based-on-daily-and-dietary-behaviours
The major goal is to identify reliable risk factors for obesity, equip doctors with the knowledge to stop a chain reaction of chronic illnesses, and improve patients' quality of life. This analysis intends to evaluate the effectiveness of five distinct machine learning (ML) approaches, including multinomial logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and K nearest neighbors. It also focused on identifying the incidence of obesity utilizing open source healthcare data, by using convenient method with advanced ML techniques to predict obesity in such an effort to transcend conventional prediction models.
Research question:
To study the cause of obesity based on the risk factors related with food habits and physical conditions. These are the findings we obtained to support our research question.
1) Out of all the remaining models, Random Forest is the most accurate at predicting with a prediction rate of 94%.
2) It can be observed that using the prediction models, we can predict the stages of obesity using the provided variables.
3) We conclude from our analyses that there is an association between obesity and dependent and independent variables such as frequency of high-calorie food intake, frequency of vegetable consumption, frequency of main meals, alcohol consumption, transportation.
